# Unsupervised-Super-Resolution-using-Cycle-GAN
Osteoporosis Detection


This project uses a Deep learning based cycle-consistent generataive model for Super Resolution

1. Generator

Two generators GA and GB are used. The only difference is that while one is used for upscaling, the other is used for downscaling

2. Discriminator

We use two discriminators for discriminating between the two domains ( Low resolution and High resolution)
